# DroneOpsCommand — Roadmap

Forward-looking work items. Shipped scope is tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`;
in-flight scope is tracked in `PROGRESS.md`. This file holds only
not-yet-started work with a clear trigger, scope, and ADR/decision
reference where applicable.

## Maps (ADR-0046, 2026-09-21)

Basemaps moved off CARTO to keyless Esri + OSM at v2.92.0 after CARTO began
serving watermarked tiles. Research:
`docs/reports/2026-09-21-basemap-provider-eval.md`.

### MP-1 — Protomaps PMTiles self-hosted on R2 — **NOT STARTED**

**Trigger:** the Esri keyless endpoints change terms, start watermarking, gate
behind a key, or the probe in MP-2 reports a provider-side change we cannot
work around. Also worth starting unprompted if the soft dark base above z16
becomes a real operational complaint.

**Why it is the real answer.** Every option in ADR-0046 except this one leaves
"what if the provider changes the terms" answered by someone else. A PMTiles
archive is a single file served over HTTP Range requests — R2 supports that
natively, no tile server, no per-tile origin cost — and the fleet already runs
R2 under the ADR-0232 backup posture. It is structurally incapable of being
watermarked, rate-limited or retired by a vendor, sharp at every zoom,
retina-native by construction, and restyleable to match the app's dark theme
exactly.

**Critically, it does not force a MapLibre migration.** `protomaps-leaflet`
renders Protomaps vector tiles to a canvas *inside* Leaflet, with a built-in
dark theme — so the five map components, the flight tracks, the airspace
polygons and the replay scrubber all stay as they are. Versions checked
2026-09-21: `protomaps-leaflet@5.1.0` (BSD-3, published 2025-06-18 — stable but
not actively moving), `pmtiles@4.5.0` (BSD-3, published 2026-08-10, active).
Re-assess that choice against MapLibre when the item is picked up.

**Scope:** ~1-2 engineer-days plus a build/refresh pipeline for the extract. A
Pacific-Northwest or CONUS extract is manageable; planet is ~120 GB and not
warranted. Swapping the app onto it is a one-line change in
`frontend/src/lib/basemaps.ts` — that is the point of the registry.

### MP-2 — Tune the probe, then arm ntfy — **NOT STARTED, earliest 2026-10-05**

> **Schedule corrected 2026-09-21.** The beat entry is
> `crontab(day_of_week=1, hour=15, minute=47)` — **Mondays 15:47 UTC = 08:47
> PDT**. v2.92.0 went live at 14:52 PDT on Monday 2026-09-21, *after* that day's
> slot, so the **first scheduled run is Monday 2026-09-28** and the second is
> 2026-10-05, which is where the "earliest 2026-10-05" above comes from. Two
> *full* weeks of history is 2026-10-12. An earlier draft said "first run Monday
> 2026-09-22"; 2026-09-22 is a Tuesday and no run happens then.

The tile-health probe ships **observe-only**: `basemap_probe_ntfy_enabled`
defaults false, so it records and logs but never publishes. The Hamming-distance
(8) and byte-band (+/-40%) thresholds in `app/services/basemap_probe.py` are
starting points, **not measurements** — basemaps legitimately change when a
provider refreshes its data, and a probe that pages falsely on the first refresh
gets muted, which is worse than no probe.

**Do:** after at least two weekly runs, read the accumulated
`system_settings.basemap_probe_last_result` history and the
`basemap_tile_health` log lines, look at the observed hash distances and byte
deltas per layer, and either widen the thresholds to the observed variance plus
headroom or confirm they hold. Then
`PUT /api/admin/basemap/tile-health/ntfy {"enabled": true}`.

**Watch for:** `esri_transportation` is the tightest margin — a synthetic
watermark moved its aHash by only 10 against a threshold of 8, because the layer
is sparse. Sparse overlays are the weak case for hash-based detection; the
blank-tile check and the byte band are what carry them.

**Note on the topic.** The probe publishes to the repo's existing
`droneops-alerts` topic, not a new `droneops-basemap` one, because a new ntfy
topic is a black hole until Bill subscribes on his phone. If a dedicated topic
is ever wanted, minting it is the easy half — getting it subscribed is the part
that must not be skipped.

### MP-3 — Re-measure the Esri zoom ceilings if flights leave Eugene — **NOT STARTED**

**Trigger:** DroneOps starts flying materially outside the Willamette Valley.

Every `maxNativeZoom` in the registry was measured over Eugene, OR
(44.0521, -123.0868) on 2026-09-21. Esri's ceilings are **location-specific**:
`World_Imagery` reaches z19 there and z20-21 over some metros, less over rural
areas. The service metadata advertises LOD 23 for every layer and is useless for
planning. Past the real ceiling every service returns a byte-identical blank
filler tile rather than a 404, so the failure is a blank map, not an error.

**Do:** walk a zoom ladder over the new area (`?blankTile=false` makes Esri
return 404 instead of filler, which makes the ladder trivial to script — do not
put that parameter on the live layers), then either raise `maxNativeZoom` where
there is more data or set it per-region.

## Flight-parser data expansion (research 2026-09-04)

### FP-1 — Extract the untapped DJI log data into a Flight Details view — **P0 + P1 LIVE; P-EVAL DONE (no crate bump exists); P2–P7 remain**

**Status 2026-09-05/06.** P0 (schema + read path) and P1 (Tier 0 extraction)
are merged and **live on BOS-HQ** — app **2.83.0**, parser **1.2.0**, alembic
head `0011_battery_src_truth`, `flight_details` + `flight_series` present and
inert (0 rows until the backfill runs). Separately, the fleet-attribution
matcher shipped at **2.90.0** (ADR-0044) and attributed all 88 previously
unlinked flights (50 Matrice 4TD, 39 Matrice 4T, 0 remaining). Evidence and
the per-phase detail are in `PROGRESS.md`.

**P-EVAL — CLOSED 2026-09-11.** Report:
`docs/reports/2026-09-11-dji-log-parser-upgrade-eval.md`. **The crate bump does
not exist**: the newest published `dji-log-parser` is `0.5.7`, already the pinned
version, and upstream has been dormant since 2025-06-07. The one unreleased
commit (Inspire-1 battery serials) was evaluated anyway — **782 comparisons over
762 distinct logs, 24 metrics, 6,756,743 `gps_track` coordinates, zero
differences**, with falsification controls proving the harness detects a real
difference when one is reachable. Nothing was adopted; `Cargo.toml` was not
touched.

*Consequence for P2:* neither hoped-for upstream fix exists. `Unknown(NNN)` does
not resolve (four placeholders live, including `Unknown(150)` Matrice 4T which
goes live at P7), so P1's fallback and P4(b)'s repair stay in full; and
`SmartBatteryStatic` is unfixed, so **P2 must build the §2.4 shim** — with the
newly derived constraint that `raw >> 8` wraps `loop_times` at 256 cycles and
the `0..=3000` plausibility gate cannot catch it.

**P2's remaining gate is the peak-RSS spike** against the parser's 256 MB
`mem_limit`, still **unmeasured** on a real full-length log. The harness is
explicitly not a proxy for it. That number, plus Bill's call on the four
follow-ups in the report's §8, is what stands between here and P2.

**Log inventory (closed; counts re-derived 2026-09-11).** **198** real
originals on the fleet — `/data/uploads/flight_logs` holds 200 files, of which 2
are the dummy test files, and 198 is the hash-set intersection with
`flights.source_file_hash`. `dji_txt` rows now number **226**. Every "182" / "184"
/ "190" / "192" figure elsewhere in this repo's FP-1 docs is stale; re-derive from
the database. All 584
OpenDroneLog-era originals recovered to BOS `~/droneops-staging/drive-logs`
and now covered by restic/R2 under tag `staging`. **28 `dji_txt` originals
remain lost and are unrecoverable from any fleet source** — HSH's backup
script only ever ran `pg_dump`, so those bytes were never captured. The one
surviving lead is time-critical and is an operator action: see
`docs/reports/2026-09-05-fp1-log-recovery-hunt.md` and the manifest at
`docs/plans/data/2026-09-05-missing-28-dji-originals.tsv`.

- **Census (input, done).** What the DJI logs carry beyond today's extraction,
  run on 7 real prod logs:
  `docs/plans/2026-09-04-dji-log-untapped-data-census.md`. Headline items
  already decoded and dropped on the floor: per-point timestamps, RC link
  quality, distance-from-home, flight-mode/RTH timeline, photo/video events,
  gimbal pointing, MSL altitude, battery current/mAh/cell balance, app warning
  strings. One call deeper: pilot GPS track (VLOS distance) and pack cycle
  count (needs a decode shim).
- **Implementation plan (written 2026-09-04; P0+P1 built and live, P2-P7 not).**
  `docs/plans/2026-09-04-flight-details-data-ingestion.md` — data model,
  parser contract, backfill + repair + re-import design, API, frontend scope,
  nine phases with sizing and per-phase tests, nine risks, and the PENDING log
  inventory.
- **Decision record.** `docs/adr/0043-flight-details-sidecar-table-for-extended-log-data.md`
  (amended same day for D1–D7) — extended log data lands in a `flight_details`
  sidecar (1:1 with `flights`, typed scalars + JSONB groups) **plus** a
  `flight_series` table for full-resolution time series, **not** as heavy JSON
  columns on `flights`. Three write sets, three guarantees: the details backfill
  never loads a `Flight` entity (structural); the repair pass merges timestamps
  into the existing track and asserts the coordinate hash inside its savepoint
  (verified); the ODL re-import is the one place headline metrics change on
  purpose, scoped to unique file matches with prior values preserved.
- **Operator ask (Bill, 2026-09-04).** "make all this extra data more
  accessible and … pull it into the DB — even if that is just a 'Flight
  Details' link somewhere on a flight in the 'flights' menu — then later we can
  figure out where else to pull that data in to utilize it." Breadth of capture
  first; presentation minimal; reports/battery/maintenance deliberately later.
- **Operator decisions folded in 2026-09-04 (D1–D7, plan §"Operator
  decisions").** Full raw pilot track stored (reports guarded); series stored at
  **full resolution** — which moved them out of the sidecar into a dedicated
  `flight_series` table; Details link on **every** flight regardless of source;
  flight logs become the **source of truth for batteries**; the backfill also
  **repairs** existing rows (per-point timestamps + the `Unknown(NNN)`
  `drone_model` literal) while leaving duration/distance/max-altitude/max-speed
  untouched; a `dji-log-parser` bump is **evaluated with a before/after diff
  first**; and recovered original DJI files **re-import over** the matching
  `opendronelog_import` rows, carrying mission attachments across.
- **Nine phases, ≈13 days.** P0 schema → P1 Tier 0 parser → P-EVAL crate diff →
  P2 Tier 1 records → P3 backfill → P4 repair → P5 UI → P6 battery → P7 ODL
  re-import. Three destructive-capable passes (P4, P7 and any `force` re-backfill)
  default to `dry_run=true`.
- **Trigger to start.** P0/P1 shipped and are live. P2 opens with a hard spike
  gate on the `dji-log-parser` record-access API — the plan's one real unknown
  (peak RSS against the parser's `mem_limit: 256m`, still unmeasured).
  **P7 is NOT blocked** — corrected 2026-09-21. It read "P7 is BLOCKED on the
  log-inventory hunt (plan §8, a PENDING table)"; **that hunt was filled in on
  2026-09-04/05** (`docs/reports/2026-09-05-fp1-log-recovery-hunt.md` + the
  manifest `docs/plans/data/2026-09-05-missing-28-dji-originals.tsv`). What P7
  inherits is a settled inventory: 584 `opendronelog_import` rows are the
  ceiling on matches, all 584 originals are recovered to BOS-HQ
  `~/droneops-staging/drive-logs/` and covered by restic/R2 under tag `staging`,
  and **28 `dji_txt` originals are unrecoverable from any fleet source**. P7 is
  gated on P2–P6 landing first, not on information.

## Billing follow-ups

### BL-1 — Formula/markup support for pass-through rate templates — NOT STARTED

- **Scope.** `rate_templates.default_rate` is a plain dollar amount; there is
  no way to express "vendor cost + X%" or "at cost" as a computed rate. The
  v2.81.0 "Third-Party Analytics (pass-through)" template works around this:
  seeded at $0.00 with the billing rule in its description ("passed through
  at cost, no markup — enter the vendor amount as the unit price"). A real
  fix would add an optional markup/formula field to `RateTemplate` and have
  the invoice line-item editor compute the unit price from an entered cost.
- **Trigger.** The operator asks for computed markups, or a second
  formula-shaped rate appears. One at-cost template does not justify the
  schema + UI work; the description-carried rule is adequate at current volume.
- **Reference.** CHANGELOG 2026-09-01 (v2.81.0); operator decision same day
  (markup drafts of +15% and +10% both rejected in favor of straight cost).

## Backup + DR follow-ups (from ADR-0041, 2026-08-17)

### BK-1 — PITR via `pg_receivewal` — DEFERRED

- **Scope.** A fifth restic lane: `pg_receivewal` streaming into a dedicated
  volume (never into pgdata), backed up alongside the existing four lanes, with
  its own liveness alert — a silently-dead `pg_receivewal` is a new dead-man
  class and must be monitored as one.
- **Trigger.** Write volume grows ~10×, **or** the RPO requirement drops below
  the current 12 h. Neither holds today: real change is ~1 MB/day, and one
  16 MiB WAL segment was produced in the 26 days before archiving was retired.
- **Explicitly NOT the path.** Re-enabling `archive_command` into pgdata. That
  is what was retired on 2026-08-17: the archive lived inside the volume it was
  meant to protect, was never pruned (5.5 GiB / 358 segments), and with
  `archive_timeout=0` had a 26-day hole — a liability wearing PITR's clothes.
  Setting `archive_timeout=300` instead would write ~4.6 GB/day of
  mostly-empty padded segments to protect ~1 MB/day of change.
- **Reference.** ADR-0041 D5 + Option D.

### BK-3 — Grafana `obs-rule-droneops-backup-stale` description text — **OPEN, UNBLOCKED 2026-09-21**

- **Scope.** The rule's `description` still tells the operator to
  `tail ~/droneops/backups/snapshot.log` and re-run `snapshot.sh`. Both are gone
  as of the §5.7 cutover. Replace with
  `journalctl -u droneops-backup.service -n 50` and
  `sudo systemctl start droneops-backup.service`.
- **Where.** `/opt/infrawatch/grafana/provisioning/alerting/observability-alerts.yml`
  — **in `~/noc-master`, not in this repo.** That is why the cutover script could
  not do it and why it survived the cutover.
- **Hard constraint.** Change the **`description` text only.** The metric names
  and expressions are a contract with `droneops_backup_last_success_timestamp_seconds`
  and must not move.
- **Trigger.** Was "at cutover". The cutover happened 2026-09-21, so this is
  unblocked now. Until it is done, the alert that fires during a backup outage
  hands the operator two commands that no longer exist — a runbook that fails
  exactly when it is needed.
- **Source.** `PROGRESS.md` §"Also at cutover (do not forget)"; ADR-0041 residual 2.
- **Owner.** TBD. ~15 minutes.

### BK-4 — `~/backups/n8n_*.sqlite` on droneops-server — **OPEN, operator decision**

- **Scope.** ~840 MB, root-owned, last written 2026-04-15. Untouched by every
  backup change so far and deliberately out of ADR-0041's scope. The final n8n
  database snapshot is already archived into this repo's restic repository under
  tag `legacy-n8n`, so the copy under `~/backups/` is redundant — but deleting
  someone's data is not an agent decision.
- **Trigger.** Bill says keep or delete.
- **Source.** ADR-0041 residual 4; `PROGRESS.md` §"Open, for Bill".

## Observability + Fleet Hygiene (follow-ups from ADR-0002, 2026-04-24)

**Context.** ADR-0002 shipped the primary fix for the operator's DJI RC
Pro flight-record upload failure (HTTPS-only base URL + fresh Capacitor
APK + existing `X-Device-Api-Key` auth). The follow-ups below are
legitimately deferred — not load-bearing for the primary fix, but
necessary to prevent the class of failure from recurring silently on
a different controller.

### FU-1 — Fleet APK version audit — ⚠ DE-PRIORITIZED (2026-04-24, ADR-0002 §5)

- **Scope.** Enumerate every DJI RC Pro / DJI Pilot 2 / DJI Fly device
  that has ever paired with DroneOps. Cross-reference against
  `device_api_keys.last_used_at` and, where possible, any version/UA
  hint the server logged on upload.
- **Trigger.** Was: "before a fleet-wide OTA push can be planned".
  Now: **optional hygiene**. ADR-0002 §5's silence watchdog + layer-1
  banner make fleet-wide drift self-detecting (any controller that
  stops uploading for >48h pages Bill via ntfy, any controller with
  a cleared `Preferences` shows the red banner on next launch). The
  audit is still useful for proactive APK OTA planning but is no
  longer load-bearing against silent data loss.
- **Deliverable.** `scripts/audit-device-fleet.py` + a one-page
  operator report listing each device label, last-seen timestamp, last
  observed APK version (if known), and upgrade plan (OTA-capable vs
  sideload-required).
- **Owner.** TBD. Likely ~1 eng day.

### FU-3 — Grafana stale-client tripwire

- **Scope.** Add a panel on the DroneOps Grafana dashboard for
  "Device auth failures (24h)" sourced from the structured WARN log
  emitted by `validate_device_api_key` in
  `backend/app/auth/device.py` (fields: `key_prefix`, `ip`,
  `user_agent`, `path`). ntfy alert at ≥5 hits/24h from ≥2
  distinct IPs (filters out a single responder testing an old phone).
  **Transport corrected 2026-08-03:** this item was written pre-cutover and
  said "Pushover". Pushover was decommissioned fleet-wide on 2026-04-26
  (noc-master ADR-0036 + this repo's
  `docs/adr/0006-pushover-to-ntfy-migration-addendum.md`); the alert must be
  built on ntfy (`https://ntfy.barnardhq.com`, topic prefix `droneops`, click
  `https://noc-mastercontrol.barnardhq.com/status/droneops`) and graded
  against the ADR-0037 five-question gate before it pages.
- **Trigger.** v2.63.4 is live. Panel can be shipped any time.
- **Deliverable.** Grafana JSON + alert rule in `~/noc-master` config.
- **Owner.** TBD. ~0.5 eng day.

### FU-4 — Device-key lifecycle policy

- **Scope.** Decide whether `device_api_keys` rows should have an
  automatic expiry/rotation (e.g., 90-day TTL with a 7-day grace
  window where both old+new keys are accepted), or stay indefinite
  revoke-on-demand. Current model is revoke-on-demand only.
- **Trigger.** Before the first real managed-tenant ships (managed
  operators are less likely to tolerate indefinite keys).
- **Deliverable.** One-page decision doc as ADR-0003 or ADR-0004
  (pick next free number), plus schema migration if rotation is
  adopted.
- **Owner.** TBD.

### FU-5 — Managed-tenant discovery (EyesOn ADR-0020 parity)

- **Scope.** When a first DroneOps managed customer is committed,
  port EyesOn's `GET /api/discovery/pair/:code` fan-out pattern +
  tenant-side `GET /api/companion/pair/:code/exists` boolean-only
  endpoint to DroneOps. Companion types a 6-digit code, hits
  discovery on the primary, adopts the tenant URL. No manual URL
  entry, matching `feedback_managed_customer_seamless.md`.
- **Trigger.** First DroneOps managed customer signed / deployment
  scheduled.
- **Deliverable.** Server endpoints + companion integration +
  `MANAGED_TENANT_URLS` env var plumbing on the primary instance's
  `docker-compose.yml`. Copy-paste-with-rename from
  `eyeson-managed`/`EyesOn` repos; estimated 1-2 eng days.
- **Owner.** TBD.

### FU-6 — End-to-end test for `device-upload` auth path

- **Scope.** Integration test that provisions a `DeviceApiKey`,
  hits `/api/flight-library/device-health` with the raw key, then
  `/api/flight-library/device-upload` with a sample DJI flight
  record fixture, and asserts the `Flight` row is created with the
  expected `source_file_hash`. Today the backend has unit coverage
  for the auth dependency; the full upload pipeline is untested
  end-to-end.
- **Trigger.** Any time; good hygiene regardless of ADR-0002's
  immediate fix.
- **Deliverable.** `backend/tests/test_device_upload.py` +
  fixture log file in `backend/tests/fixtures/flight-records/`.
- **Owner.** TBD. ~0.5 eng day.

---

## LLM-assisted report surface (follow-ups from ADR-0015, 2026-05-14)

**Context.** ADR-0015 (Accepted 2026-05-14) pinned the contract:
*mission reports are client-facing artifacts; operator-facing coaching
is explicitly out of scope.* The current LLM dispatch
(`backend/app/services/llm_provider.py`) and shared system prompt
produce one artifact — the customer-facing report — and that is the
entirety of the LLM-assisted surface in this product. The follow-ups
below harden the prompt path against future audience drift; they do
not introduce additional LLM surfaces.

**Note on dropped item:** an earlier draft listed an operator-facing
retrospective surface (FU-AI-1) as a follow-up. The operator confirmed
at close-out that no operator debrief was ever requested; FU-AI-1 is
**dropped**, not deferred. See ADR-0015 §"Rejected alternative" for the
rationale.

### FU-AI-3 — Prompt source-of-truth relocation — ⚠ DE-PRIORITIZED (2026-05-14)

- **Scope unchanged.** Move `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` out of
  `backend/app/services/ollama.py` into
  `backend/app/services/llm_prompts.py`; update imports in
  `claude_llm.py` and `ollama.py`. The prompt is the cross-provider
  contract; it does not belong in one provider's adapter.
- **Why de-prioritized.** Aegis's audience-fix commit (`22469ed`)
  deliberately left the prompt in `ollama.py` to keep the change
  footprint tight (CHANGELOG entry calls this out). The relocation is
  a pure refactor with no behavioral coverage; pairing it with the
  audience fix would have expanded the surgical surface without adding
  safety. Item still stands on its own merits — the cross-provider
  contract does logically belong outside any one provider adapter — but
  is no longer urgent.
- **Trigger.** Next time the prompt is meaningfully edited (e.g., a
  managed-tenant tone addendum per FU-AI-4 lands), bundle the
  relocation. Until then, leave it.
- **Deliverable.** Refactor commit + one-line import update in two
  files. No version bump (no behavior change).
- **Owner.** TBD.

### FU-AI-4 — Per-tenant prompt override (managed-hosting only, optional)

- **Scope.** For managed-hosting tenants that want to brand the report
  voice differently ("warm and conversational" vs "technical and
  terse"), expose a tenant-scoped prompt-fragment override in
  `system_settings` (key e.g. `llm_prompt_tone_addendum`). The
  audience-separation invariant from ADR-0015 stays hard-coded and not
  overridable; only the tone-shaping addendum is tenant-tunable. The
  runtime soft-block gate (FU-AI-RUNTIME-GATE) still applies — a
  managed-tenant tone override that produced an audience leak would be
  flagged in `MissionReportEdit` like any other draft.
- **Trigger.** First managed-hosting customer asks for a different
  voice. Not before — premature flexibility.
- **Deliverable.** One new setting key, one prompt-construction site
  updated, one Settings-page UI element gated to `managed_instance=true`.
- **Owner.** TBD. ~0.5 eng day.

  *Standalone justification (post 2026-05-14 close-out):* FU-AI-4 is
  about tenant-branded voice/tone, not about audience separation. It
  remains coherent under the tightened ADR-0015 scope — the single
  client-facing artifact can still have its voice tuned per tenant
  without re-introducing a second audience.

### FU-AI-QUALITY-PASS — Overall mission-report quality iteration — NOT STARTED (watching brief)

- **Status.** NOT STARTED. Awaiting operator direction on priority and scope.
- **Source.** Operator feedback at the 2026-05-14 ADR-0015 close-out,
  verbatim: *"its ok for now but it needs to get better."* No specific
  changes requested — this is a signal that the current report quality
  bar is not the destination, not a directive to make a specific
  change today.
- **Scope (open-ended).** Quality improvement to the client-facing
  mission report generated by `backend/app/services/llm_provider.py`
  and the shared `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`. The audience-separation
  contract from ADR-0015 stays load-bearing; quality work happens
  inside that contract, not by relaxing it.
- **Candidate areas (inference, not commitment — operator has not
  specified).** Listed so future sessions have a starting point if
  asked to dig in, *not* as a punch-list to grind through:
  - Section 5 framing strength — currently "Client Follow-Up Items"
    with an explicit OMIT-fallback; possible iterations on how the
    section is structured when it does fire.
  - Weak / hedging language — sentence-level passes against
    "appeared," "seemed," "was observed to" where a definitive
    statement is warranted.
  - Conciseness — current drafts tend toward narrative bulk; signal
    density per paragraph may be a lever.
  - Signal-to-noise on routine flights — when nothing notable
    happened, the report still produces five sections. May be worth a
    "routine flight" prompt variant or an explicit length budget.
  - Consistency across mission types — same prompt drives both
    inspection and survey reports; per-mission-type prompt fragments
    are a possible direction (overlaps with FU-AI-4's per-tenant
    fragment infrastructure if that lands first).
- **Trigger to act.** Operator-driven. This is a watching-brief item:
  next session that touches the prompt should ask the operator what
  specifically he wants improved before opening work. Do not assume
  a direction and start editing.
- **Deliverable.** TBD when scoped. Likely a prompt iteration plus an
  extension of the existing 17-test `test_report_audience_guard.py`
  suite for any new structural guarantees added during the pass.
- **Owner.** TBD. Operator scopes when ready.

## Repo hygiene

### H-1 — Compose `APP_VERSION` defaults / Sentry release drift — **✅ DONE 2026-09-21 (v2.92.1)**

- **What was wrong.** The five compose `${APP_VERSION:-…}` defaults sat at
  `2.67.3` for ~25 minor versions, and BOS-HQ's hand-set `.env` pinned
  `APP_VERSION=2.67.4`. That env var was the **Sentry/GlitchTip release tag**
  on both halves, so every error since ~v2.67 was grouped under a stale
  release. (Correction to the earlier draft of this item: the Login/Setup
  footers were **not** affected — they render `__APP_VERSION__`, vite-defined
  from `package.json`, and showed 2.92.0 correctly.)
- **Fix shipped (v2.92.1).** The dependency was removed instead of guarded:
  `backend/app/observability/sentry.py` now tags releases from
  `app.version.APP_VERSION` and `frontend/src/lib/sentry.ts` from
  `__APP_VERSION__` — both are bumped source files already covered by
  `tests/test_app_version_parity.py`. The `APP_VERSION` env var and the
  compose defaults are no longer load-bearing anywhere (they still get bumped
  for tidiness). The stale `APP_VERSION=2.67.4` line was removed from BOS-HQ
  `~/droneops/.env` the same day.
- **Not built, by decision.** A compose-default parity test — nothing reads
  those defaults any more, so a test would guard a cosmetic value.

## Completed

Closed work, moved here on **2026-09-21** so the sections above hold only open
items. Entries are **verbatim**; nothing was rewritten. Index first, full text
below.

|---|---|---|
| `BK-2` | 2026-08-18 | Standby `archive_mode` on `10.99.0.2` turned off + 1.5 GiB / 99 stale WAL segments deleted; pgdata 2.3 G → 851 M. A promotion can no longer recreate ADR-0041 Gap 7. |
| `FU-2` | 2026-04-24 | Unauthenticated `GET /health` shim — v2.63.4. |
| `FU-7` | 2026-04-24 | Zero-touch device API key rotation — v2.63.6 + DroneOpsSync v1.3.25 (ADR-0003). |

**Also closed but not moved, because they live inside a still-open parent:**
`FP-1 P0` (v2.82.0 `8b29ef9`), `FP-1 P1` (v2.83.0 + parser 1.2.0 `439b952`) and
`FP-1 P-EVAL` (closed 2026-09-11, no crate bump exists) — all under § FP-1, whose
P2–P7 remain open. `BK-CUT` (the ADR-0041 §5.7 cutover) was never a ROADMAP item;
it lived in `PROGRESS.md` and was **executed 2026-09-21**.

### BK-2 — Standby `archive_mode` on `10.99.0.2` — ✅ DONE 2026-08-18

- **Scope.** The droneops standby (`droneops-db-standby` on svdp-dev) still
  carries `archive_mode = 'on'` and the old
  `archive_command = cp %p …/wal_archive/%f` in its `postgresql.auto.conf`,
  inherited from the base backup.
- **Why it matters.** Inert today — `on` does not archive during recovery, only
  `always` does. **But a promotion would immediately recreate ADR-0041 Gap 7 on
  that host**, silently accumulating an unpruned archive inside the pgdata
  volume it is supposed to protect.
- **Fix.** `ALTER SYSTEM SET archive_mode='off'; ALTER SYSTEM RESET
  archive_command;` then restart the standby (archive_mode needs a restart, not
  a reload) and confirm it resumes streaming and the slot returns to `active`.
- **Trigger.** Next planned maintenance window on svdp-dev, or immediately
  before any deliberate failover drill. Deferred here only because it needs a
  standby restart, which was out of scope for the backup change.
- **Executed 2026-08-18 (operator-approved).** `ALTER SYSTEM` is unavailable in
  recovery, so `postgresql.auto.conf` was edited directly (`archive_mode='off'`,
  `archive_command` line removed) followed by a container restart. Also found
  and deleted **1.5 GiB / 99 stale WAL segments** already sitting in the
  standby's own `wal_archive` (inherited from the seeding basebackup) — pgdata
  2.3 G → 851 M. Verified after: `pg_is_in_recovery()=t`, `archive_mode=off`,
  wal receiver `streaming`, primary slot `chad_hq_standby` active with empty
  `replay_lag`. A promotion can no longer recreate Gap 7.

### FU-2 — Unauthenticated `GET /health` shim — ✅ SHIPPED v2.63.4 (2026-04-24)

- Delivered as a plain JSON alias (same payload as `/api/health`).
  Reasoning for deviating from the spec'd "update-required" banner: a
  pre-v2.34 Gson client with `setLenient(false)` would choke on any
  payload that doesn't match its expected shape, so custom banner
  fields buy nothing on the failing client and are confusing to
  modern clients. The WARN log on auth-failure in
  `backend/app/auth/device.py` is the actual stale-client tripwire
  (key_prefix + IP + user-agent + path); FU-3's Grafana panel consumes
  that stream directly. FU-2 rate-limiting not needed since `/health`
  never triggers the WARN path.

### FU-AI-RUNTIME-GATE — Runtime audience-leak soft-block — ✅ SHIPPED `4953edf` (2026-05-14) and **LIVE IN PRODUCTION**

- **Scope.** Wire `report_audience.has_audience_leak()` (shipped at
  commit `22469ed` as a callable module) as a post-generation gate on
  every LLM-produced report draft. On leak detection: flag the draft
  (do not silently pass), surface the offending phrasings in the
  `MissionReportEdit` editorial UI banner, allow operator override
  ("soft-block" — never block the operator from shipping, but never
  let the leak be invisible). Tripwire on top of the corrected prompt,
  not a substitute for it.
- **Delivered as.** Wire-in lives at the persistence site, not the
  per-provider call paths: `_apply_audience_findings(report, llm_content)`
  in `backend/app/tasks/celery_tasks.py:150-189` runs the detector after
  every LLM generation and persists findings into two new `Report`
  columns (`has_audience_leak BOOL`, `audience_leak_details JSONB`)
  added via the idempotent `_add_missing_columns` migration path in
  `backend/app/main.py` (`def _add_missing_columns` is at `:67` as of
  2026-09-21 — the original `:114-122` citation has drifted). Helper never raises (detector failure
  logs and leaves defaults so generation never 500s). No regen loop
  per operator directive — detection + surfacing only, with a
  doc-string-lock test preventing drift toward retry-clean. Yellow
  `IconAlertTriangle` Mantine `Alert` banner above the FINAL REPORT
  editor in `MissionReportEdit.tsx` lists each matched phrase with its
  rule name; Save / PDF / Send remain enabled (editorial review IS the
  gate). Test coverage: 10 new hermetic tests in
  `backend/tests/services/test_audience_leak_persistence.py` (10/10
  green); existing 17-test audience suite stays green; full backend
  suite 240 passed, 1 skipped, 2 pre-existing unrelated failures.
- **Deploy status — corrected 2026-09-21.** This read *"Personal-instance only;
  no deploy yet (`.deployer-disabled` per fleet convention)"* for four months.
  Both halves were wrong. `.deployer-disabled` never disabled the fleet deployer
  (ADR-0018), and the gate has been deployed continuously since `4953edf`
  (2026-05-14) — every push to `main` since then has rebuilt and recreated the
  stack. **Verified on the running system 2026-09-21:**
  `_apply_audience_findings` is wired at
  `backend/app/tasks/celery_tasks.py:307`, and both `reports.has_audience_leak`
  and `reports.audience_leak_details` exist in the production database on
  BOS-HQ. The 24h-soak precondition is long satisfied.

### FU-AI-2 — Prompt regression fixture — ✅ SHIPPED at commit `22469ed` (2026-05-14)

- **Delivered as `backend/tests/services/test_report_audience_guard.py`**
  rather than the originally proposed `test_llm_report_audience.py` path.
  17-test suite: Layer 1 (4 tests) locks structural guarantees of the
  system prompt (audience pin, operator-address ban, Section-5 reframe,
  operator-notes framing); Layer 2 (13 tests) exercises the deterministic
  regex-based detector against nine representative bad phrasings, a
  known-clean third-person sample, empty input, diagnostic snippet
  shape, and the verbatim shape of the operator-reported leak.
  Hermetic — no network, no LLM, no DB. Runs ~1.8s. All 17/17 passing
  on Python 3.12.3.

### FU-7 — Zero-touch device API key rotation — **CLOSED 2026-04-24** (v2.63.6 / DroneOpsSync v1.3.25)

- **Status.** PR open against `main` on this repo (`claude/zero-touch-key-rotation-backend`); paired DroneOpsSync PR open against `main` (`claude/auto-rotation-client`). Operator reviews + merges.
- **Shipped scope.** Backend grace-window dual-key auth + rotated-key hint in `/api/flight-library/device-health` response + Celery finalizer task (15-min beat) + Pushover FYI + admin endpoint `POST /api/admin/devices/{id}/rotate-key`. Bootstrapped `backend/tests/` infrastructure (15 tests, all green).
- **Trigger.** Bill rotated M4TD in-place 2026-04-24 AM; operator had to manually paste new key on RC Pro Settings. v1.3.24's preflight gate surfaced the invalid-key state correctly, but eliminating the paste step was the real goal.
- **Deliverable.** ADR-0003 (`docs/adr/0003-zero-touch-device-key-rotation.md`) + plan (`docs/plans/2026-04-24-zero-touch-key-rotation.md`) + migration + endpoint + Celery task + tests. Remote routine `trig_01KiBK88vqs6vtRf75rkxcw8` initially shipped an empty branch; aegis re-ran and produced both PRs.
- **Owner.** aegis (scaffold); Bill (review + merge).

### FU-8 — Ground-up audit residuals (2026-06-11 multi-agent pass) — **CLOSED 2026-06-11** (v2.70.0/v2.70.1)

- **Status.** CLOSED. All six residuals + every remaining P2/P3 audit finding
  shipped across v2.70.0 (Alembic ADR-0022, async backup jobs, lean mission
  list, Stripe per-call client, DISTINCT ON maintenance, health-gate trim,
  cpus fences, versioned BOS override) and v2.70.1 (Settings lazy-tab split,
  backup-jobs UI, useApiCache rollout, Airspace visibility guard).
  Consciously NOT done (new follow-ups, operator-triggered):
  * Device-upload Celery decoupling (audit P2-2 full leg) — requires a
    DroneOpsSync client release; backend per-file batch isolation is pinned
    by tests in the meantime. **DESIGNED 2026-06-15** — ADR-0023 + DroneOpsSync
    ADR-0008 + staged plan `docs/plans/2026-06-15-device-upload-async-decoupling.md`.
    Recommended: ship the DroneOpsSync socket-timeout-is-per-file fix as a
    standalone fast-follow (one-line, backend-independent) ahead of the full
    async route. Implementation not yet started.
  * Trigram (pg_trgm) indexes for the leading-wildcard ILIKE searches —
    rejected from 0002 as B-tree can't serve them; revisit if flight search
    slows at scale.
- **Original scope (for the record).** Was: Phases 1–3 of the audit SHIPPED (v2.68.7 image-upload OOM
  fix, v2.68.8 event-loop unblocking sweep + eager-load scoping, v2.69.0
  standby-safe startup + hot-path indexes + streaming flight ingest).
  Full findings: `docs/plans/2026-06-11-ground-up-audit.md`; ADR-0021.
- **Remaining items — the stale list was DELETED 2026-09-21; the correction below
  is what remains.** That six-item "deliberately deferred" list was written when
  FU-8 was *opened* and never trimmed when FU-8 was *closed*, so the two halves
  of this entry contradicted each other for months. Keeping the superseded list
  beside its own correction only ever gave a reader two answers. The correction,
  verified against the code at HEAD, is retained verbatim:

  > **Corrected 2026-08-03 — that list was stale; nearly all of it SHIPPED.**
  > Verified against the code at HEAD, not against prose:
  >
  > - **#1 lean mission list** — shipped; `app/routers/missions.py` strips the
  >   heavy `flight_data_cache` keys (`_strip_cache_heavy_keys`,
  >   `_scalar_cache_from_flight`).
  > - **#2 Alembic** — shipped (ADR-0022, v2.70.0). `backend/alembic/versions/`
  >   held `0001_baseline_schema` … `0009_mission_dl_email_sent_at` when this
  >   correction was written; as of 2026-09-21 it holds **eleven** revisions
  >   (`0010_flight_details` and `0011_battery_source_of_truth`, added by
  >   ADR-0043), all present inside the running `droneops-backend-1` container
  >   on BOS-HQ, and
  >   ADR-0036 made the advisory-locked Alembic boot the single schema path.
  >   **Anything that still says "DroneOpsCommand has no Alembic; add columns to
  >   `_add_missing_columns()` in `main.py`" is describing the pre-v2.70.0 repo
  >   and must not be followed.** (Alembic head is `0011_battery_src_truth` as of
  >   2026-09-21.)
  > - **#3 per-call `StripeClient`** — shipped;
  >   `app/services/stripe_service.py::stripe_client()`, consumed by
  >   `client_portal.py` and `stripe_webhook.py`.
  > - **#4 backup/restore as a Celery job** — shipped; `run_backup_job_task` in
  >   `app/tasks/celery_tasks.py` (the comment there still cites "FU-8 #4").
  > - **#5** — `_save_original_file` no longer exists in `backend/app`; only the
  >   optional `/reprocess` refactor half may remain.
  > - **#6 P2/P3 index audit** — shipped as Alembic revision `0002_p2_p3_indexes`.

  Two things the correction flagged as genuinely *not* done, and they are the
  only live residue of FU-8 — both are already named in the CLOSED note above:
  * **Device-upload Celery decoupling (audit P2-2, full leg)** — designed
    2026-06-15 (ADR-0023 + DroneOpsSync ADR-0008 +
    `docs/plans/2026-06-15-device-upload-async-decoupling.md`), **not started**.
    Requires a DroneOpsSync client release. Recommended fast-follow: ship the
    DroneOpsSync socket-timeout-is-per-file fix standalone (one line,
    backend-independent) ahead of the full async route.
  * **Trigram (`pg_trgm`) indexes** for the leading-wildcard ILIKE searches —
    rejected from migration `0002` because B-tree cannot serve them. Revisit
    only if flight search slows at scale.
  * The optional half of #5 (refactoring `/reprocess`'s new-flight branch onto
    `_build_flight_from_parsed`) may also remain; `_save_original_file` itself
    is gone.

- **Trigger to act.** Operator-driven, or the next perf session.
- **Owner.** TBD.
