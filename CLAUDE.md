# CLAUDE.md — Project instructions for Claude Code

## Version Bumping (REQUIRED on every code change)

Every commit that changes application code MUST include a version bump. Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Bump PATCH for fixes/tweaks, MINOR for new features, MAJOR for breaking changes.

Update the version in ALL 4 of these files:

1. `README.md` — line near top: `**Version X.Y.Z**`
2. `frontend/package.json` — `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
3. `backend/app/main.py` — `version="X.Y.Z"` in the FastAPI() call
4. `frontend/src/components/Layout/AppShell.tsx` — `vX.Y.Z` displayed in the navbar footer

Include the version tag in the commit message (e.g. `— v1.7.8`).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python / FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React / TypeScript, Mantine UI, Vite
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (self-hosted)
- **Deploy**: `update.sh` pulls latest, rebuilds changed services

## Branch Workflow (REQUIRED)

This project uses a `dev` branch for development and `main` for production releases.

**Before committing any code change, ALWAYS ask the user:** "Should this go to `dev`, `main`, or both?"
- Do NOT assume a target branch — always ask first.
- `dev` is the default development branch; `main` is production-stable.
- The `update.sh` script pulls from `dev` by default on the server.

## Conventions

- Commit messages: short summary, optional detail paragraph, always end with session link
- Keep UI styling consistent: dark theme, cyan accents, Bebas Neue headings, Share Tech Mono for data
