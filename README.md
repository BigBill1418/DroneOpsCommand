DroneOpsCommand is a self-hosted, full-stack platform for managing commercial drone operations end-to-end. It covers the complete lifecycle from flight data ingestion and GPS telemetry visualization through AI-powered report generation, invoicing, and client delivery — all running on your own hardware.

Designed for FAA Part 107 certified operators running missions such as search & rescue, inspections, mapping, videography, and more.

### Why DroneOpsCommand?

- **100% self-hosted** — runs on your own hardware via Docker Compose. No cloud dependencies, no per-seat licensing, no subscription fees.
- **AI report generation** — local via Ollama (Qwen 2.5 3B default) or cloud via Claude API. Your data stays on your hardware with Ollama; Claude API available for faster, higher-quality output.
- **White-label ready** — company name, tagline, and branding are fully configurable from the Settings UI. No code changes needed to make it yours.
- **Full lifecycle** — flight log upload, GPS path visualization, animated flight replay with video export, telemetry analysis, mission management, AI reports, PDF export, invoicing, and email delivery in one platform.
- **Real-time airspace** — live aircraft tracking via OpenSky Network with anonymous or authenticated access.
- **Mobile-friendly** — responsive dark-themed UI works on phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2+)
- x86_64 or ARM64 host

**Minimum resources (self-hosted):**

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| RAM      | 8 GB    | 16 GB       | Ollama alone reserves ~4 GB for the quantized model; backend + Postgres + flight-parser + Redis under load push past 8 GB total. |
| CPU      | 4 cores | 6–8 cores   | `docker-compose.yml` pins Ollama to 6 cores. Fewer cores means slow AI report generation. |
| Disk     | 30 GB   | 100 GB+     | Flight logs, Postgres, Ollama model, video exports. Grows with usage. |

> **Docker Desktop users (Windows/Mac) — READ THIS.** Docker Desktop runs containers inside a Linux VM with its own RAM/CPU limits. The defaults are usually **too low** for DroneOpsCommand. Open **Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources** and raise **Memory to at least 8 GB** (16 GB recommended) and **CPUs to at least 4** before `docker compose up`. If the VM runs out of memory the stack will crash at startup or under load with no clear error. `setup-server.sh` does not run on Windows/Mac, so you won't see a preflight warning — allocate the VM resources manually.

> **Windows?** See the [Windows Self-Hosting Guide](docs/windows-self-hosting.md) for step-by-step Docker Desktop + WSL 2 setup.

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/BigBill1418/DroneOpsCommand.git
cd DroneOpsCommand
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Set your secrets (IMPORTANT: change these before first run)
#    Edit .env and update at minimum:
#    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
#    - JWT_SECRET_KEY

# 3. Launch
docker compose up -d

# 4. Wait for the AI model to download (first run only, ~1.5GB)
docker compose logs -f ollama-setup

# 5. Open the app
#    Web UI:   http://localhost:3080
#    API docs: http://localhost:3080/docs
#    First visit shows the setup wizard — create your admin account there.
```

### What happens on first startup

1. PostgreSQL schema is created automatically
2. Setup wizard prompts you to create the admin account (no env vars needed)
3. Aircraft fleet (6 DJI models) and rate templates (8 billing presets) are pre-loaded
4. Ollama downloads the Qwen 2.5 3B model (~1.5GB)
5. All storage directories are created

### Auto-start & auto-deploy (one command)

Run the setup script to install boot auto-start and git-based auto-deploy:

```bash
sudo ./setup-server.sh                    # tracks main by default
sudo ./setup-server.sh --branch <name>    # track a different branch
sudo ./setup-server.sh --uninstall        # remove everything
```

This installs three systemd units:
- **`droneops.service`** — starts the Docker stack on boot
- **`droneops-autopull.service`** — checks git for new commits and deploys
- **`droneops-autopull.timer`** — triggers the check every 60 seconds

```bash
# Useful commands
systemctl status droneops                 # stack status
systemctl list-timers droneops-autopull*  # next auto-deploy check
journalctl -u droneops-autopull -f        # auto-deploy logs
tail -f autopull.log                      # detailed deploy log
```

All containers have healthchecks and `restart: unless-stopped`, so individual services auto-recover from crashes. The backend retries DB and Redis connections on startup to handle restart race conditions.

### Personalize it

After logging in, go to **Settings > Branding** to set your company name, tagline, website, and contact email. These appear on PDF reports, emails, the login page, and customer-facing pages.

---

## Updating

### Auto-Deploy (recommended)

The `autopull.sh` script runs via systemd timer (every 60 seconds), polling the tracked git branch for new commits. When changes are detected, it:

1. Pulls the latest code
2. Detects which services changed (frontend, backend, or both)
3. Rebuilds only the changed Docker images
4. Restarts services with `docker compose up -d`
5. Verifies the deploy via health checks
6. Tracks deployed commits to avoid unnecessary rebuilds

Install auto-deploy with `setup-server.sh` (see [Quick Start](#auto-start--auto-deploy-one-command)).

### Watchtower (base image updates)

Watchtower runs as a sidecar service checking for updated base images (PostgreSQL, Redis, Ollama) daily. By default it auto-updates; set `WATCHTOWER_MONITOR_ONLY=true` to get notifications without auto-updating. Configure `WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_URL` in `.env` for alerts (supports Slack, Discord, email, etc. via [Shoutrrr](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/)).

### Manual update

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

Renders branded PDF reports from Jinja2 HTML templates via WeasyPrint. Includes mission metadata, report narrative, flight path map, aircraft specs, mission images, invoice with line items and totals, payment links, and optional download link.

### Email Service
Async SMTP client that sends HTML emails with the PDF report attached. Loads configuration from database settings first, falls back to environment variables. Supports TLS.

### LLM Provider Service
Dual-provider LLM client supporting Ollama and Claude API. The active provider is selectable from Settings or via `LLM_PROVIDER` env var.

- **Ollama** — HTTP client to the `/api/generate` endpoint. Sends a structured prompt with mission data, flight telemetry, and operator notes. Temperature 0.3 for consistency, 300s timeout, 6 CPU threads.
- **Claude API** — Anthropic SDK client using Claude Sonnet. Same structured prompt, cloud-processed. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### OpenDroneLog Client
REST client that fetches flight data from a self-hosted OpenDroneLog instance. Handles multiple API endpoint patterns for version compatibility. Normalizes field names between camelCase and snake_case. Extracts GPS tracks for map rendering.

### Map Renderer
Generates GeoJSON FeatureCollections with flight path LineStrings, start/end markers, and convex hull polygons. Calculates coverage area in acres using UTM projection and Shapely geometry with configurable buffer distance. Renders static PNG maps using OpenStreetMap tiles.

### Flight Parser Service
Standalone microservice that decrypts and parses DJI flight logs using the DJI Cloud API. Extracts GPS tracks, telemetry time-series, drone metadata, and battery information from encrypted TXT log files.

### Airspace Service
Proxies requests to the OpenSky Network API for real-time aircraft position data. Supports anonymous and OAuth2-authenticated modes. Converts search radius to bounding box coordinates and normalizes the response into a clean aircraft list.

### Weather Service
Aggregates data from 4 external APIs: Open-Meteo (current conditions), AviationWeather.gov (METAR, TFRs), aviationapi.com (NOTAMs fallback), and NWS (weather alerts). Location configurable from Settings.

## Roadmap

### Next — Multi-Tenant Managed Hosting

Transform DroneOpsCommand from a self-hosted tool into a revenue-generating SaaS product. The self-hosted open-source path remains for operators who want it — managed hosting is the commercial tier.

**Tenant Architecture**
- Schema-per-tenant isolation in PostgreSQL. Each tenant gets their own schema with identical table structures.
- Tenant provisioning API: signup → subdomain claim → payment → automatic schema creation and admin user seeding.
- JWT tenant claims with schema routing middleware. Every authenticated request resolves to the correct tenant schema.
- CI test coverage verifying tenant A cannot read tenant B's data under any code path.

**Billing & Licensing**
- Stripe subscription integration: plan tiers with mission limits, user seat limits, and storage quotas.
- Stripe Checkout hosted page for signup — no custom payment frontend required.
- Stripe Customer Portal for self-service plan changes, payment method updates, and invoice history.
- Webhook-driven plan enforcement: upgrade/downgrade/cancel reflected in tenant configuration automatically.
- Stripe Tax add-on for US sales tax compliance.

**AI Processing (Cloud Offload)**
- Managed tenants use cloud LLM (Anthropic or OpenAI API) instead of local Ollama.
- Per-tenant API key configuration with model selection.
- Celery queue hardening: retry logic, dead letter queue, per-tenant job isolation, queue depth monitoring.
- SLA-aware job priority to prevent report generation backlog across tenants.

**Infrastructure**
- Application servers behind a load balancer with subdomain-based tenant routing.
- Managed PostgreSQL with automated backups.
- S3-compatible object storage for mission images, reports, and deliverables (per-tenant path prefixes).
- Signed URLs for secure file delivery.
- Redis for Celery broker and session caching.

**Pricing Tiers (Planned)**
- Starter — limited missions/month, 1 user, cloud AI reports, email support.
- Professional — higher limits, multi-user with RBAC, priority report generation, UNAS integration.
- Enterprise — unlimited, custom branding, dedicated support, SLA.

### Planned — Additional Features

- **Thermal Inspection Report Engine** — Ingest DJI radiometric RJPEG thermal imagery, auto-detect hotspot anomalies via configurable temperature delta thresholds and OpenCV contour detection, annotate visual images with bounding boxes, GPS coordinates, and measured temperatures, and generate branded PDF inspection reports. Plugs into the existing Celery/WeasyPrint report pipeline as a thermal-specific report template. Industry-configurable severity presets (solar/NETA electrical/roofing).
- **Multi-User / Role-Based Access** — Admin and Operator roles at minimum. Foundation for teams and the multi-tenant SaaS tier. Implement before schema changes get harder.
- **Notification System** — Email and in-app alerts for overdue invoices, upcoming maintenance, battery cycle limits, certificate expirations, and completed report generation.
- **Report Template Library** — Multiple PDF templates for different mission types. Inspection reports, SAR after-action reports, videography delivery summaries. Operator-buildable custom templates. LLM prompt adapts per template type.
- **Airspace Pre-Check Workflow** — Drop a pin before mission creation and get a pre-flight airspace assessment: LAANC status, nearby TFRs, Class B/C/D proximity. Uses existing weather/FAA API infrastructure.
- ~~**Claude API Integration**~~ — **Done.** Switchable from Settings or via `LLM_PROVIDER=claude` env var.
- **React Native Android App** — Mission creation, photo capture on-site, report review, and customer lookup from the field. Communicates with the stack via JWT-authenticated HTTPS API.
- **Voice-to-Text** — On-device speech recognition in the Android app for dictating operator field notes hands-free during or after missions.
- **DroneOpsSync Deep Integration** — Field-captured photos auto-upload to the correct mission. Field notes from the controller pre-populate report narrative. JWT API is already in place.
- **Public API & Webhooks** — Let third-party tools (dispatch software, QuickBooks, project management) integrate with Command. Webhooks on mission status changes, invoice payment, and report delivery.
- **Public Demo Instance** — **Live** at [command-demo.barnardhq.com](https://command-demo.barnardhq.com) with pre-loaded sample data, sandboxed operations (demo guard middleware), demo-mode banner with "Deploy Your Own" CTA, and 24-hour auto-reset. See `docker-compose.demo.yml` for deployment config. **Always start the demo via `./bootstrap.sh`** — never `docker compose up -d` directly. The bootstrap script validates `.env.demo` before compose runs, so a missing or incomplete env file produces a clear error instead of silently falling back to default credentials (the failure mode that caused a 6h+ outage on 2026-04-16).
